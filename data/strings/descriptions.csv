fds_decimator,WEAPON,"The Decimator Cannon uses a considerable amount of energy to fire a large shell at very high speeds, making sure the enemy's armour gets destroyed as quickly as possible.",Assault,,
fds_dual_autoblaster_cannon,WEAPON,"The Dual Autoblaster Cannon is a weapon that possesses two large blaster cannons capable of firing projectiles with more than twice the damage of most other options, making it one of the finest large weapons that can be mounted into a capital ship.",Assault,,
fds_quad_blaster_battery,WEAPON,"The Quadruple Blaster Battery provides a curtain of fire in the direction it is firing, thanks to the quad blasters that fire in quick succession. It generates an enormous amount of flux when firing continuously, which can quickly deplete the capacity of smaller ships that end up mounting this.",Assault,,
fds_heavy_autoblaster_battery,WEAPON,A triple barreled cannon that fires a quick burst of High Explosive shots. Usually paired with the Heavy Autoblaster Cannon or the Ion Battery to provide the ship with a mixed damage source that can punish enemy ships for having their shields both raised and lowered.,Assault,,
fds_heavy_autoblaster_cannon,WEAPON,"Being the main choice of the Fringe Defence Syndicate when it comes to medium energy weapons, the range and fire rate of this weapon is great for rookies and veteran captains alike, with the ships being able to provide sustained fire on the target.",Assault,,
fds_light_autoblaster_cannon,WEAPON,"A single cannon taken from the Heavy Autoblaster Cannon, allowing ships that lack medium mounts to experience some of the power its bigger brother can provide.",Assault,,
fds_light_pd_blaster,WEAPON,"This short range blaster has a stupendous rate of fire making it easy to shoot at an incoming missile or fighter. However, this increased rate of fire comes with a decreased damage per shot, requiring some amount of shots to hit their target before any visible effect occurs.",Point Defense,,
fds_light_blaster,WEAPON,"This short range blaster has a stupendous rate of fire making it easy to shoot at an incoming missile or fighter. However, this increased rate of fire comes with a decreased damage per shot, requiring some amount of shots to hit their target before any visible effect occurs.",Point Defense,,
fds_ion_battery,WEAPON,"An average sized energy cannon that fires a short burst of Ion beams emanating electro-magnetic energy, quickly disabling enemy systems and/or engines.",Special,,
fds_Alliance_turbo_L,WEAPON,"What may seem like a harmless weapon turns out to be a very capable hull-mounted energy-based cannon, making the Loyalty one of the best equipped and combat capable combat freighters available in the market.",Special,,
fds_Alliance_turbo_P,WEAPON,"What may seem like a harmless weapon turns out to be a very capable hull-mounted energy-based cannon, making the Loyalty one of the best equipped and combat capable combat freighters available in the market.",Special,,
fds_heavy_beam,WEAPON,"In an attempt to improve the Graviton Beam, bigger emitters were installed with refined lenses, resulting in a beam that is about twice as powerful with a slight reduction in range due to bigger energy losses and dispersion.",Close Support,,
fds_pd_laser_mk_ii,WEAPON,"The first experiment made by the Syndicate's engineers trying to upgrade the Point Defence Laser, by sacrificing some range for increased power.",Point Defense,,
fds_pd_laser_mk_iii,WEAPON,"Continuing their work from the PD Laser Mk. II, this laser further decreases its range in exchange for increased power, making it capable of destroying some of the most resilient missiles single-handedly.",Point Defense,,
fds_remnant_dagger,WEAPON,"A weapon engineered using alien technology mixed with the beam emitters of the Council Spear resulting in a beam weapon that also deals EMP damage, making this a very dangerous weapon in the right hands.

Similar to Council Spear, this fires a short burst of energy instead of a continuous stream, meaning some care should be taken when aiming such weapons.",Close Support,,
fds_council_spear,WEAPON,"This high power long range beam deal massive damage in a short burst, providing a quick way to melt the enemy's shield, armor or hull, whichever comes first.

It is a very versatile weapon since it damaged all defence types equally, and due to its burst damage makes it suitable to finish off unshielded or nearly overloaded enemies.",Strike,,
fds_fighter_rocket,WEAPON,"Inspired by the launchers of other rocket based bombers, this launcher delivers a large amount of rockets in the general direction it is pointing at. Each individual rocket does not carry enough explosives to be considered a threat by itself, but the sheer volume of fire is enough to at least scare away any rookie captain.",,,
fds_ion_missile_single,WEAPON,"The warhead of this missile is composed of several high-density high conductivity materials that disrupt both shield generators and electronic systems alike, easily disabling key components on an enemy ship.",,,
fds_hydra_single,WEAPON,"These slow guided torpedoes are not as powerful and the regular torpedoes due to the space the guidance system takes, but it's still powerful enough to severely damage an enemy ship, should one of these hit its target.",Fire Support,,
fds_hydra_2x_rack,WEAPON,"These slow guided torpedoes are not as powerful and the regular torpedoes due to the space the guidance system takes, but it's still powerful enough to severely damage an enemy ship, should one of these hit its target.",Fire Support,,

fds_hydra_2x_pod,WEAPON,"These slow guided torpedoes are not as powerful and the regular torpedoes due to the space the guidance system takes, but it's still powerful enough to severely damage an enemy ship, should one of these hit its target.",Fire Support,,
fds_tali_mrm,WEAPON,A medium range missile launcher that fires a barrage of 4 missiles filled with explosives. They are deadly in numbers and should not be underestimated.,Fire Support,,
fds_tali_mrm_single,WEAPON,A medium range missile launcher that fires a barrage of 4 missiles filled with explosives. They are deadly in numbers and should not be underestimated.,Fire Support,,
fds_torture_forward_cannons,WEAPON,While developing new weapons someone in the research division asked a simple question: What if we strapped three Hellbore cannons to the front of a ship? The result was this massive cannon barrage mounted at the tip of the Torture-class Dreadnought.,Assault,,
fds_kane,WEAPON,"A strange weapon that fires three dispersed projectiles in a single shot, making it somewhat lose its power over long ranges, but deadly when up close to the enemy, as each individual projectile deals an amount of damage that can't be ignored.",Assault,,
fds_chaingun_L,WEAPON,"FDS engineers saw chainguns as weapons with a lot of potential, so they did some experimenting with the design and tried different ammunition types in the process, including some old tungsten based shells. In order to test this specific variant they mounted one under each wing of the Grief Mk.II-class Frigate, and remained there to this day.",Assault,,
fds_chaingun_P,WEAPON,"FDS engineers saw chainguns as weapons with a lot of potential, so they did some experimenting with the design and tried different ammunition types in the process, including some old tungsten based shells.

fds_penitence,SHIP,A basic fighter launched in large numbers with each fighter being equipped with two light blasters.,,,
fds_oppression,SHIP,"A fighter equipped with two light blasters, two small anti-fighter missiles and decent armor, making this a hard fighter to defeat in a dogfight.",,,
fds_distress,SHIP,"This fast interceptor has incredible manoeuvrability, speed and acceleration, making it capable of catching up with most enemy fighters as fast as possible.",,,
fds_disgrace,SHIP,"Quite similar to the Distress Interceptor, the Disgrace is instead a bomber equipped with an anti-ship missile and two light blasters, making this a well equipped bomber.",,,
fds_guilt,SHIP,"A durable and powerful fighter, thanks to the Ion cannons installed on both wings besides the light blasters installed at the front of the fighter, giving this wing an incredible supporting capability both to other wings and to the ships it may be escorting.",,,
fds_remorse,SHIP,"A Heavy Bomber based on the Guilt, trading both ion cannons by missile launchers. Each wing fires a barrage of Tali missiles giving the enemy a bad time if their shields are down.",,,
fds_anguish,SHIP,"Large, well armored and with a shield, this heavy bomber is as large as some frigates and a big threat to many unsuspecting ships, thanks to its powerful mine launcher.",,,
fds_pain,SHIP,"Armed with an Ion Missile and the usual Light Blaster for self defence this is a bomber that punishes its targets whether they have their shields raised or not, making this a welcome addition to any carrier group.",,,
fds_rage,SHIP,"After seeing the effectiveness of rocket based bombers in combat FDS engineers have decided to design a brand new bomber equipped with a rocket launcher mounted on each side of the fuselage. The rockets aren't as powerful as any of the competition, but they are more numerous, enough to ignore most PD systems.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
fds_loyalty,SHIP,"This small combat freighter started out as a nimble poorly armed freighter used by many civilians in the past. War, however, made some of its owners install custom weapons to the front of this ship, and in some cases even more powerful engines, making this ship a threat to small raider and/or pirate fleets while keeping some of its original cargo capacity.",,,
fds_fidelity,SHIP,"This is a small freighter considered to be a combat freighter to some, a useless freighter to others. It does not have the firepower to defend itself reliably but it has enough cargo space to be considered a decent cargo ship, reason why it's still used by some civilian cargo companies.",,,
fds_obedience,SHIP,"Carrying several fuel tanks in its undercarriage this is the go-to choice for people looking to move large amounts of fuel over any sort of distance. This ship is capable of being outfitted with a range of weaponry, ranging from missile launchers to machine guns, making this ship anything but ill-equipped when it comes to its own defensive capabilities.",,,
fds_burden,SHIP,"For many years this was the largest cargo ship available to the Syndicate, capable of moving large amounts of resources between the core of the Fringe to the outer regions with ease. Like its fuel carrying brother, this is well armed and capable of holding on its own against small numbers of smaller enemies.",,,
fds_duty,SHIP,"This ship is a stripped version of the Burden-class Freighter. Most of the unnecessary internal components were removed in order to make this the ship with the highest cargo carrying capacity of any of the Syndicate freighters. Due to this, the cargo bay doors were also removed, leaving the ship with two big openings that can be easily used to strike damage deep into the ship, forcing it to always be escorted.",,,
fds_diligence,SHIP,"The ultimate tool in the Syndicate's fleet, this ship does most heavy work inside the Fringe, from constructing ships to guiding ships through bloated docks. However, the qualities and capabilities of this ship come with a cost.",,,
,,,,,
fds_prudence,SHIP,"The history of this ship is based on criminal actions, where crime lords sought smaller and faster ships so they could move without raising any alarms.
It is light armored and armed, but has an exceptional manoeuvrability and is small enough to dodge most enemy fire.",,,
fds_sorrow,SHIP,"For years the Sorrow-class Frigate was the designated frigate class of many smaller combat units, with decent weaponry for its size and enough mobility for many fleets to form wolf packs with the mission of cleaning up the remaining enemy support ships.",,,
fds_regret,SHIP,"A specialty ship used for tactical disabling enemies during combat. The fragility of this ship is often the main cause for officers to keep it from being used in the fleets, although many like to have at least one for the sole purpose of fleet versatility.",,,
fds_agony,SHIP,"The first in a series of missile-oriented frigates, the Agony-class Frigate is an agile missile boat capable of carrying enough missiles to take down a small fleet, given the pilot has the skills to do so.",,,
fds_agony_mk_ii,SHIP,"An upgrade over its predecessor boasting slightly improved combat systems, allowing for better flux management and longer combat deployment.",,,
fds_grief,SHIP,"This ship may have less weaponry than the Agony-class frigates but more than makes up for it in speed, coming near to the fastest frigates the Syndicate has ever built for combat.",,,
fds_grief_mk_ii,SHIP,A version of the Grief-class Frigate in which a cloaking device has been installed. Usually accompanies the Disturbance-class Frigate in spec-ops missions or patrol groups due to the concealability of the ship.,,,
fds_disturbance,SHIP,"Built primarily for spec-ops groups and infiltration units this ship is capable of sneaking past the enemies defences and inflict damage where they less expect. Compared to the Syndicate's frigates this is one of the most maneuverable, giving it the capability of striking fast and leaving before the enemy can make a move.",,,
fds_melancholy,SHIP,"A hard-hitting frigate known for its speed and strike capabilities, this frigate is agile enough to position itself in the best position possible to strike deep into the enemies weaknesses, thanks to some of the most powerful engines available in the Syndicate.",,,
fds_melancholy_mk_ii,SHIP,"Similar to its predecessor but with an increase in speed and maneuverability, at the cost of less space to carry larger weapon mounts. This is the fastest ship the Syndicate has to offer and is always present in strike groups of fast intervention units.",,,
,,,,,
fds_affliction,SHIP,"The Affliction-class Destroyer is considered to be the blueprint from which most other smaller destroyers came from due to the need of having smaller and faster destroyers. This one is a rather large destroyer with more heavy weapon mounts than all the smaller destroyers, making this ship more suitable for long range engagements supporting the smaller more agile ships.",,,
fds_despair,SHIP,"The Despair-class Destroyer is a fast and powerful ship, adopted by the newer Syndicate doctrine of faster, lighter and smaller ships. It composes most pursuit fleets to support the faster frigates when extra firepower is required. It has a very powerful broadside, an advantage used by many captains who circle their enemies at high speed while maintaining a constant stream of destruction.",,,
fds_rancour,SHIP,"Previously assigned to the transport of diplomats and VIPs this ship quickly saw the need to be converted to a combat ship since diplomatic agreements were rare or inconclusive, with most people choosing fire over words. It did retain its incredibly powerful engine with immense combat capabilities, making it capable of keeping up with more powerful allies or even catch up to faster ships while in combat.",,,
fds_shame,SHIP,"A ship designed to carry small fighter contingents without the need of having a slow carrier in the fleet. The design is quite similar to the Pride-class Destroyer but less combat oriented, trading armor and firepower for two fighter bays.",,,
fds_desolation,SHIP,"An older design from a much older age, this was the first attempt at making a strong destroyer capable of taking higher volumes of fire but in a smaller package, since the old domain's doctrine dictated that only large battlecruisers and battleships could make their way through the battlefield. This resulted in one of the strongest destroyers ever built with a decent amount of firepower and survivability, at the cost of a severe reduction in speed, rendering this ship only capable of escorting larger fleets.",,,
fds_pride,SHIP,"This destroyer has more heavy weapon mounts than any other Syndicate destroyer, giving it enough firepower to rival some cruisers. It has more armor than many of the other destroyers making this arguably the toughest and most dangerous destroyer produced by the Syndicate.",,,
,,,,,
fds_atonement,SHIP,"This support cruiser always accompanies larger fleets seeking to overwhelm and control an area thanks to its Engine Signature Dampener. It is quite fragile, and should not be left on its own.",,,
fds_retaliation,SHIP,"A cruiser any captain loves to have in the fleet, this cruiser is well armed, armored and brings additional fighters into the battlefield. Its versatility has inserted the Retaliation-class Cruiser into most - if not all - fleets throughout the Fringe, both as a flagship and to provide support to the larger capital ships.",,,
fds_submission,SHIP,This combat freighter is powerful enough to cause severe damage to any pirate looking for easy loot. With as much firepower as a small cruiser this freighter should not be underestimated.,,,
fds_revenge,SHIP,"A strong yet agile cruiser. Not as strong as some of its brethren in terms of armor or firepower, but fast enough to outmaneuver many of the ships its bigger companions fail to keep up with. It is mainly a dedicated missile cruiser and a threat even to the biggest battleships.",,,
fds_wrath,SHIP,"Rumoured to be originated from the Retaliation-class Cruiser, this ship had its fighter bays traded for a pair of frontal weapon mounts and additional anti-fighter defence positions.",,,
,,,,,
fds_fear,SHIP,"The Fear-class Battlecruiser is often the first line of defence against any kind of enemy, boasting a decent amount of missile firepower both from the missile barrages in both the ship's flanks and other smaller missile launchers, in addition to a high count of weapon mounts.",,,
fds_torture,SHIP,"Having been created in one of the experiments on some Hatred-class Battleship hulls, the Torture-class Dreadnought is a rather large ship that unlike the Hatred has two large weapon mounts besides the triple hellbore cannons installed into the hull directly. This ship has immense frontal firepower as well as in its broadsides, leaving the back of the ship one of the very few weakspots of this ship, an issue common to most Syndicate's ships.",,,
fds_terror,SHIP,This huge dreadnought was made to fulfill one job: to make the enemy tremble in horror as they watch the destruction of their allies. It is one of the very few ships in the fleet that has large weapon mounts but combining that with an above average weapon count and a small fighter contingent the Syndicate may very well have the most powerful ship in all of the Fringe.,,,
,,,,,
fds_hatred,SHIP,"The first Battleship made by the Syndicate. It may not have any large sources of firepower, but it more than compensates with an increased number of weapon mounts and a small fighter contingent, forcing the enemy to think twice before venturing against such a ship.",,,
fds_suffering,SHIP,"The Syndicate's dedicated battleship, the Suffering-class Battleship, is based on the Hatred-class Battleship, having its hangar bays removed and replaced with a bigger power generator, heavier armor and an increased weapon count.
Furthermore, an experimental burn drive has been installed on this ship providing superior speed in combat, allowing its captain to explore new and even more aggressive tactics.",,,
,,,,,

,,,,,
fringe_defence_syndicate,FACTION,"Born during a long lasting war, the Fringe Defence Syndicate is the final attempt at defending the Fringe Worlds against the attacks that threat the balance of power in the region.
The Syndicate was forced to rethink and redo their administration and military doctrines in order to withstand the threat of foreign nations, greatly affecting the characteristics of the fleet, where it became notable the existence of larger, imposing ships from older days and new, faster, smaller ships originated from this change of ideas.

The Syndicate's military is anything but friendly, and will not think twice when facing the opportunity of crippling or even obliterating the enemy. They are very loyal to their cause and the feeling of revenge only makes them fight harder and more fearless than ever.",,,

maintenance_bots,RESOURCE,"These robots have the purpose of performing maintenance and repair tasks both on buildings and vessels. They can operate under any type of conditions with minimal loss to their work quality, and have a vast amount of tools at their disposal, integrated into their arms like a robotic swiss army knife.",,,
energy_crystals,RESOURCE,"These crystals can be found inside very unique caves, formed ages ago through unknown natural processes. Their utility and possible applications are still being researched, as these crystals appear to have the capability of holding immense amounts of energy, hence its name. Like with most cases, however, some scientists are already developing new ways to use these crystals to produce more powerful weapons.",,,

fds_signature_dampener,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The Engine Signature Dampener intercepts and interferes with the engine signals that have a certain signature, slowing down the targeted ships considerably. The range of the system is quite imposing, but also renders the host ship vulnerable.",Utility,,
fds_quantum_generator,SHIP_SYSTEM,The Quantum Singularity Generator creates temporary singularities which can be used by ships to essentially teleport to another location. The temporary nature of these openings requires the use of incredibly powerful engines to propel the ships fast enough to make the crossing.,Movement,,
fds_overclocked_sensor_array,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The ship's sensors are temporarily overclocked, providing improved targeting feeds for all of the fleet while also increasing the ship detection range while in combat.",Offensive,,
